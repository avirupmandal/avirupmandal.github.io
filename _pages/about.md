I am currently pursuing my MTech-PhD dual degree in Communication Engineering from the Department of [Electrical Engineering](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web) 
of [IIT Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/) (Indian Institute of Technology Bombay). I am fortunate to have two amazing professors, 
[Dr. Parag Chaudhuri](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~paragc/) and [Dr. Subhasis Chaudhuri](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~sc/), as my supervisors. 
I completed my B.E. in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering from [Jadavpur University](http://www.jaduniv.edu.in/), Kolkata in 2015. 

My research interests include Physics-based animation, Fracture dynamics, Haptics, High performance computing and Machine Learning.

I am a recipient of [Qualcomm Innovation Fellowship](https://www.qualcomm.com/research/university-relations/innovation-fellowship/2021-india) from India in 2021.
