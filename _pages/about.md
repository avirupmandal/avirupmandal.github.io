I am currently pursuing my MTech-PhD dual degree in Communication Engineering from the Department of [Electrical Engineering](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web) 
of [Indian Institute of Technology Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/). I am fortunate to have two amazing professors, 
[Dr. Parag Chaudhuri](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~paragc/) and [Dr. Subhasis Chaudhuri](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~sc/), as my advisors. 
I completed my B.E. in [Electronics & Telecommunication Engineering](http://www.jaduniv.edu.in/view_department.php?deptid=84) from [Jadavpur University](http://www.jaduniv.edu.in/), Kolkata in 2015. 

My research interests include Physics-based animation, Fracture dynamics, Haptics, High performance computing and Machine Learning.

I am a winner and super winner of [Qualcomm Innovation Fellowship](https://www.qualcomm.com/research/university-relations/innovation-fellowship/2021-india) from India in 2021 and 2022 respectively.
