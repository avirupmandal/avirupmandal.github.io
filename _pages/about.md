I am currently pursuing my MTech-PhD dual degree in Communication Engineering from the Department of [Electrical Engineering] (https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web) 
of Indian Institute of Technology Bombay [IIT Bombay] (https://www.iitb.ac.in/). I am fortunate to have two amazing professors, 
[Dr. Parag Chaudhuri] (https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~paragc/) and [Dr. Subhasis Chaudhuri] (https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~sc/), as my supervisors. 
I completed my B.E. in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering from [Jadavpur University] (http://www.jaduniv.edu.in/), Kolkata in 2015. 
My research interests include Physics based animation, Fracture dynamics, Haptics, High performance computing and Machine Learning.

I am a recipient of [Qualcomm Innovation Fellowship] (https://www.qualcomm.com/research/university-relations/innovation-fellowship/2021-india) from India in 2021.

This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).
