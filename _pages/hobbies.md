Astrophysics
======
I take a keen interest in astrophysics specially in Relativistic Physics. You can call me a self-taught ameture astrophysicist. Some of the astrophysics books that I have read are as follows (*Warning: may not have understood them fully or possibly misunderstood some concepts*).

*One, Two, Three...Infinity, The Road to Reality, A Brief History of Time, Relativity: Special, General, and Cosmological, Gravitation and cosmology: principles and applications of the general theory of relativity, The Mathematical Theory of Black Holes and a few more.*
