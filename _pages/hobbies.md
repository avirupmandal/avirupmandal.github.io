Astrophysics
======
I take a keen interest in astrophysics specially in Relativistic Physics. You can call me a self-taught ameture astrophysicist. Books related to astrophysics and similar subjects that I have read are as listed <a href="https://avirupmandal.github.io/technical-books/" style="text-decoration:none">here</a>. (*Warning: may not have understood them fully or possibly misunderstood some concepts*).
