Reading
======
I like reading novels, short stories and popular science books in my spare time. Some of the books that I have read can be found <a href="https://avirupmandal.github.io/general-books/" style="text-decoration:none"><span style="color:RoyalBlue">here</span></a>.


Astrophysics
======
I take a keen interest in astrophysics particularly in Special and General Relativity. You can call me a self-taught amateur astrophysicist. Some of the books related to astrophysics and similar subjects that I have read are listed <a href="https://avirupmandal.github.io/technical-books/" style="text-decoration:none"><span style="color:RoyalBlue">here</span></a>.


**Feel free to drop me a line if our interests match. I am always up for a healthy discussion.**
